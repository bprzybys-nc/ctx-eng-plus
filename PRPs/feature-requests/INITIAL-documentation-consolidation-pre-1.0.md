# INITIAL: Documentation Consolidation & Drift Reduction (Pre-1.0 Finalization)

## Feature Description

Complete remaining documentation gaps identified in GRAND-PLAN to reduce drift from 26.21% to target 10-12% range and finalize pre-1.0 release readiness.

**Context:** All 28 core PRPs are executed and production-ready. Security verified (PRP-22: CVSS 8.1→0). However, some critical documentation is missing from SystemModel.md and other reference docs, causing elevated drift score.

**Goal:** Close documentation gaps, ensure all executed work is properly documented, reduce drift to healthy range (<15%), and complete pre-1.0 checklist.

---

## Core Requirements

### 1. Add Security Section to SystemModel.md

**What:**
- Document PRP-22 security verification (CWE-78 command injection elimination)
- Include CVSS score reduction (8.1 → 0)
- Document test verification (38/38 security tests, 631 regression tests)
- List affected files and mitigation strategy (shlex.split + shell=False)

**Why:**
- Critical security improvement not documented in main model
- Users/maintainers need to understand security posture
- Drift reduction: explicitly called out in GRAND-PLAN line 362

**Where:**
- SystemModel.md - new "Security" section after "Testing Framework"

---

### 2. Document PRP-21 Reliability Improvements

**What:**
- Summarize 30+ critical bug fixes in update_context.py
- Document design flaw resolutions
- Explain reliability improvements
- Update Context Management section in SystemModel.md

**Why:**
- Major reliability work (PRP-21) not fully documented
- Users need to understand update-context behavior
- Part of production hardening story

**Where:**
- SystemModel.md - Context Management section enhancement
- Possibly tools/README.md update

---

### 3. Verify All 28 Executed PRPs Are Documented

**What:**
- Cross-reference GRAND-PLAN PRP list (1-25, plus variants) against SystemModel.md
- Ensure each PRP's outcome is captured in relevant section
- Identify any missing implementations or undocumented features
- Create mapping table: PRP → SystemModel section

**Why:**
- Completeness check before 1.0
- Ensures no work is lost/forgotten
- Reduces documentation drift

**Deliverable:**
- Checklist or table showing all PRPs mapped to docs

---

### 4. Update Drift Score Tracking

**What:**
- Run `ce analyze-context` to get current drift score
- Document before/after drift reduction
- Update GRAND-PLAN.md with latest numbers
- Verify drift is in healthy range (<15%)

**Why:**
- Validate that documentation work actually reduces drift
- Track progress toward 1.0 readiness
- Evidence of completion

**Deliverable:**
- Updated drift score in GRAND-PLAN.md
- Drift report review

---

### 5. Create Final Pre-1.0 Checklist

**What:**
- List all remaining tasks before 1.0 release
- Mark completed items (security, core features, docs)
- Identify any blockers or open questions
- Define clear "done" criteria

**Why:**
- Clear roadmap to 1.0
- Avoid scope creep
- Give stakeholders confidence in release readiness

**Deliverable:**
- Checklist in GRAND-PLAN.md or separate doc
- Clear go/no-go decision point

---

## Why This Matters

**Impact:**
- **Drift Reduction:** 26.21% → 10-12% (healthy range)
- **Release Readiness:** Unblocks 1.0 by closing doc gaps
- **User Experience:** Complete, accurate reference documentation
- **Maintainability:** Future developers understand security + reliability work

**Risk if Skipped:**
- High drift persists, indicating model divergence
- Security improvements not visible to users
- Critical reliability fixes undocumented
- Confusion about what's actually implemented

---

## Examples & Context

### Example 1: Security Section (Missing from SystemModel.md)

**Current State:** PRP-22 executed, security verified, but not in SystemModel.md

**Desired State:**
```markdown
## Security

**Vulnerability Mitigation (PRP-22):**
- **Issue:** CWE-78 command injection via shell=True
- **CVSS:** 8.1 (HIGH) → 0 (eliminated)
- **Mitigation:** Replaced shell=True with shlex.split() + shell=False
- **Affected Files:** 6 locations in tools/ce/
- **Verification:** 38/38 security tests pass, 631 regression tests pass
- **Status:** Production-ready, no vulnerabilities
```

### Example 2: PRP-21 Documentation (Partial in SystemModel)

**Current State:** Context Management section mentions update-context, but not reliability fixes

**Desired State:** Add subsection documenting:
- 30+ critical bug fixes
- Design flaw resolutions (error handling, state management)
- Improved reliability patterns

### Example 3: PRP Mapping Table

**Desired Deliverable:**
| PRP | Feature | SystemModel Section | Status |
|-----|---------|---------------------|--------|
| PRP-1 | Validation L1-L4 | Validation Framework | ✅ Documented |
| PRP-22 | Security (CWE-78) | Security | ❌ Missing |
| PRP-21 | Update-context fixes | Context Management | ⚠️ Partial |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

---

## Constraints & Considerations

**Constraints:**
- Documentation-only PRP (no new code features)
- Must follow existing SystemModel.md structure
- KISS principle: clear, concise, no fluff
- No scope creep (defer post-1.0 features)

**Considerations:**
- May need to read multiple executed PRPs for details
- Drift score validation requires running analysis
- Coordination with GRAND-PLAN updates

**Out of Scope (Post-1.0):**
- CLI wrappers for state management
- Pipeline executor implementations
- PRP-13 Phase 4-5 (advanced hardening docs)

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ SystemModel.md has complete Security section documenting PRP-22
2. ✅ PRP-21 reliability improvements documented in Context Management section
3. ✅ All 28 executed PRPs mapped to SystemModel sections (with completion status)
4. ✅ Drift score reduced to <15% (verified via `ce analyze-context`)
5. ✅ Pre-1.0 checklist created with clear done criteria
6. ✅ GRAND-PLAN.md updated with latest drift score
7. ✅ No new features introduced (doc-only changes)

---

## Effort Estimate

**Total: 6-8 hours**

- Security section: 1-2h (research PRP-22, write section)
- PRP-21 documentation: 2-3h (read PRP, document fixes)
- PRP mapping verification: 1-2h (cross-reference all 28 PRPs)
- Drift score update: 0.5h (run analysis, update GRAND-PLAN)
- Pre-1.0 checklist: 1h (synthesize from GRAND-PLAN)

---

## Priority

**HIGH** - Blocks 1.0 release

**Rationale:**
- Explicitly called out in GRAND-PLAN next steps (lines 444-446)
- Required to reduce drift to healthy range
- Security documentation gap is critical for users
- No code features can proceed until docs are complete
