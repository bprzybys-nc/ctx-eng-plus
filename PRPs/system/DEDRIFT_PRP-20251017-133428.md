# Drift Remediation - 2025-10-17

## Feature

Address 6 drift violations detected in codebase scan on 2025-10-17.

**Drift Score**: 20.7% (ðŸš¨ CRITICAL)

**Violations Breakdown**:
- Error Handling: 5
- Naming Conventions: 0
- KISS Violations: 1
- Missing Examples: 0

## Context

Context Engineering drift detection found violations between documented patterns (CLAUDE.md, examples/) and actual implementation.

**Root Causes**:
1. New code written without pattern awareness
2. Missing examples for critical PRPs
3. Pattern evolution without documentation updates

**Impact**:
- Code quality inconsistency
- Reduced onboarding effectiveness
- Pattern erosion over time

## Examples

### Violation 1

File tools/ce/blueprint_parser.py has missing_troubleshooting (violates examples/patterns/error-handling.py): Add ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting guidance

### Violation 2

File tools/ce/cli_handlers.py has deep_nesting (violates pattern): Reduce nesting depth (max 4 levels)

### Violation 3

File tools/ce/context.py has missing_troubleshooting (violates examples/patterns/error-handling.py): Add ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting guidance

### Violation 4

File tools/ce/pipeline.py has missing_troubleshooting (violates examples/patterns/error-handling.py): Add ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting guidance

### Violation 5

File tools/ce/pattern_extractor.py has missing_troubleshooting (violates examples/patterns/error-handling.py): Add ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting guidance

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All HIGH priority violations resolved
- [ ] Missing examples created for critical PRPs
- [ ] L4 validation passes (ce validate --level 4)
- [ ] Drift score < 5% after remediation
- [ ] Pattern documentation updated if intentional drift

## Technical Notes

**Files Affected**: 6
**Estimated Effort**: 2h based on violation count
**Complexity**: MEDIUM
**Total Items**: 6 violations + 0 missing examples

**Priority Focus**:
- Address HIGH priority violations first
- Create missing examples for critical PRPs
- Run L4 validation after each fix
