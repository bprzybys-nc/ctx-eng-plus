# PRP Sizing Constraint Analysis and Optimal Breakdown Strategy

## 1. TL;DR

**Objective**: PRP Sizing Constraint Analysis and Optimal Breakdown Strategy

**What**: Investigate why PRP-4 was generated as a monolithic 1060-line document instead of being automatically broken down into smaller, manageable sub-PRPs (PRP-4.1, PRP-4.2, etc.). Define measurable PRP size...

**Why**: Enable functionality described in INITIAL.md with 4 reference examples

**Effort**: Medium (3-5 hours estimated based on complexity)

**Dependencies**:

## 2. Context

### Background

Investigate why PRP-4 was generated as a monolithic 1060-line document instead of being automatically broken down into smaller, manageable sub-PRPs (PRP-4.1, PRP-4.2, etc.). Define measurable PRP size constraints, create an automated breakdown algorithm, and integrate size validation into the PRP generation workflow to prevent "PRP obesity" in future.

**Date**: 2025-10-13
**Priority**: HIGH
**Type**: Process Improvement / Methodology

## üéØ Problem Statement

PRP-4 ("/execute-prp Command Orchestration") was generated as a monolithic 1060-line document with 18 hours of estimated effort across 5 phases. This resulted in:

1. **Overwhelming Cognitive Load**: Single PRP contained 5 distinct features (parser, orchestration, validation loop, self-healing, CLI)
2. **Suboptimal Execution**: Manual implementation took significant effort to integrate all components
3. **Testing Gaps**: 40% test coverage vs 80% target - testing complexity grew with PRP size
4. **Review Complexity**: Peer review identified 11 success criteria, only 7 fully met
5. **Increased Risk**: HIGH risk rating due to multiple complex, interdependent components

**Core Question**: Why wasn't PRP-4 automatically broken down into smaller, manageable PRPs (PRP-4.1, PRP-4.2, etc.) during generation?

---

## üîç Investigation Goals

### Primary Objective

Determine optimal PRP size constraints and establish automated breakdown criteria for PRP generation.

### Research Questions

1. **Size Metrics**: What are the measurable indicators of "PRP obesity"?
   - Line count threshold?
   - Effort hours threshold?
   - Number of phases threshold?
   - Number of files/functions threshold?
   - Complexity score (McCabe, cognitive)?

2. **Breakdown Criteria**: When should a PRP be split?
   - ‚úÖ **Natural Phase Boundaries**: Can phases be independent PRPs?
   - ‚úÖ **Dependency Analysis**: Which phases have minimal interdependencies?
   - ‚úÖ **Risk Segmentation**: Can HIGH-risk components be isolated?
   - ‚úÖ **Testing Scope**: Can test coverage be improved by splitting?

3. **Current Process Gaps**: Why didn't `/generate-prp` flag PRP-4 for breakdown?
   - Is there size validation in `generate_prp()`?
   - Are there automated breakdown recommendations?
   - Is there a PRP composition analyzer?

4. **Optimal Structure**: What would PRP-4 decomposition look like?

   ```
   PRP-4.0: Execution Framework Foundation (Meta-PRP)
   ‚îú‚îÄ PRP-4.1: Blueprint Parser (3h, LOW risk)
   ‚îú‚îÄ PRP-4.2: Execution Orchestration Engine (5h, MEDIUM risk)
   ‚îú‚îÄ PRP-4.3: Validation Loop Integration (4h, MEDIUM risk)
   ‚îú‚îÄ PRP-4.4: Self-Healing Implementation (4h, HIGH risk)
   ‚îî‚îÄ PRP-4.5: CLI Integration & Testing (2h, LOW risk)
   ```

## üí° Proposed Approach

### Phase 1: Data Collection (2 hours)

- Analyze all existing PRPs (PRP-1 through PRP-4)
- Extract metrics: lines, hours, phases, functions, risk level
- Correlate with execution outcomes (confidence score, test coverage, issues found)

### Phase 2: Constraint Definition (2 hours)

- Define optimal PRP size ranges based on data
- Establish thresholds for automatic breakdown triggers:

  ```
  GREEN: ‚â§500 lines, ‚â§8h, ‚â§3 phases, LOW-MEDIUM risk
  YELLOW: 500-800 lines, 8-12h, 3-4 phases, MEDIUM risk
  RED: >800 lines, >12h, >4 phases, HIGH risk
  ```

### Phase 3: Decomposition Algorithm (4 hours)

- Implement size validator in `generate.py`
- Create decomposition proposal generator
- Design parent-child PRP relationship model
- Validate with PRP-4 as test case

### Phase 4: Tooling Integration (3 hours)

- Update `/generate-prp` with size checks
- Add `ce prp analyze <prp-file>` command
- Integrate with PRP generation workflow
- Test with new PRP generation

### Phase 5: Documentation & Rollout (2 hours)

- Update Model.md with sizing guidelines
- Create decomposition examples
- Update CLAUDE.md with best practices
- Document escape hatches (when monolithic PRPs are acceptable)

## üö® Risk Assessment

**Risk**: MEDIUM

**Challenges**:

1. **Subjectivity**: Size thresholds may vary by complexity - algorithm needs calibration
2. **Over-decomposition**: Too many small PRPs increases coordination overhead
3. **False Positives**: Some large PRPs may be legitimately monolithic (e.g., database migrations)
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing PRPs not affected, only new generations

**Mitigation**:

- Start with conservative thresholds, tune based on feedback
- Provide override flag for intentional monolithic PRPs
- Human review step before applying decomposition
- Gradual rollout with opt-in period

---

## üìù Expected Deliverables

1. **Analysis Report**: `docs/research/prp-sizing-analysis.md`
2. **Updated `generate.py`**: Size validation + decomposition logic
3. **New CLI Command**: `ce prp analyze <file>`
4. **Documentation Updates**:
   - `PRPs/Model.md` Section 3 (PRP Structure & Sizing)
   - `examples/prp-decomposition-patterns.md`
   - CLAUDE.md PRP best practices section
5. **Test Suite**: Unit tests for decomposition algorithm

## üîó Related Work

- **PRP-4**: Source of investigation (1060 lines, 18h, 5 phases)
- **PRPs/Model.md**: Section 3.1 (PRP Structure) - needs sizing guidelines
- **PRPs/GRAND-PLAN.md**: May need revision if PRPs are systematically decomposed
- **tools/ce/generate.py**: PRP generation logic to enhance

---

## üí≠ Open Questions

1. Should decomposition be automatic or advisory?
2. What's the acceptable false positive rate for size warnings?
3. Should there be different thresholds for different PRP types (feature vs refactor vs fix)?
4. How to handle cross-cutting concerns that span multiple sub-PRPs?
5. Is there a role for LLM-assisted decomposition (beyond rule-based algorithm)?
