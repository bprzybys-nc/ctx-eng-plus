## Superstage 1: MVP - Production-Ready PRP Workflow

**Goal:** Enable complete autonomous PRP generation and execution with 10/10 confidence

**Duration:** 5 weeks (72-103 hours)

**Milestone:** End-to-end PRP workflow operational from INITIAL.md to production code

---

### PRP-1: Level 4 Pattern Conformance Validation

**Goal:** Implement architectural consistency validation against INITIAL.md EXAMPLES

**Why:** Prevent architectural drift, ensure implementation matches specification patterns

**Key Deliverables:**
- Pattern extraction algorithm from EXAMPLES section
- Drift score calculation (0-100% divergence)
- Threshold-based escalation logic:
  - 0-10%: Auto-accept, continue
  - 10-30%: Auto-fix, log warning
  - 30%+: HALT and escalate to user
- User decision flow (accept/reject/update EXAMPLES)
- DRIFT_JUSTIFICATION section handler
- Integration with confidence scoring (10/10 requires L4 pass)

**Technical Approach:**
- Extend `tools/ce/validate.py` with `validate_level_4(prp_path: str) -> Dict[str, Any]`
- Use Serena MCP `find_symbol` to analyze implementation structure
- Pattern matching for:
  - Code structure (async/await vs callbacks)
  - Error handling (try-catch patterns)
  - Data flow (props, state, context)
  - Naming conventions (camelCase, PascalCase, snake_case)
- Interactive CLI for user decisions on high drift
- Persist DRIFT_JUSTIFICATION to PRP YAML header

**Integration Points:**
- `tools/ce/validate.py`: New validation level
- `tools/ce/__main__.py`: CLI command `ce validate --level 4`
- Confidence scoring: Update from 9/10 to 10/10 threshold
- Model.md Section 3.3.3: Implementation reference

**Dependencies:** None (foundation for validation pipeline)

**Estimated Effort:** 20-30 hours

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ Detects 90%+ of pattern divergence cases
- ✅ User escalation flow functional with clear diff display
- ✅ DRIFT_JUSTIFICATION persisted correctly to PRP YAML header for PRP-6 aggregation

- Integration tests: Full L4 validation with mock PRPs
- E2E test: Escalation flow with user interaction simulation

---

### PRP-2: PRP State Management & Isolation

**Goal:** Implement PRP-scoped state management preventing cross-execution contamination

**Why:** Multiple PRPs executing over time can cause state leakage, desynchronization, and context pollution

**Key Deliverables:**
- Checkpoint naming convention: `checkpoint-{prp_id}-{phase}-{timestamp}`
- Memory namespacing: `{prp_id}-checkpoint-*`, `{prp_id}-learnings-*`, `{prp_id}-temp-*`
- Cleanup protocol automating ephemeral state removal
- New CLI commands:
  - `ce prp start <prp-id>` - Initialize PRP execution context
  - `ce prp checkpoint <phase>` - Create PRP-scoped checkpoint
  - `ce prp cleanup <prp-id>` - Execute cleanup protocol
  - `ce prp restore <prp-id> [phase]` - Restore to checkpoint
  - `ce prp status` - Show current PRP execution state
  - `ce prp list` - List all PRP checkpoints

**Technical Approach:**
- Create `tools/ce/prp.py` module with state management functions
- Git tag integration for checkpoints: `git tag -a checkpoint-{prp_id}-{phase} -m "{message}"`
- Serena MCP integration for memory operations:
  - `write_memory(f"{prp_id}-checkpoint-{phase}", state_data)`
  - `read_memory(f"{prp_id}-checkpoint-latest")`
  - `delete_memory(f"{prp_id}-temp-*")`
- Cleanup protocol (Section 5.6 in Model.md):
  1. Delete intermediate git checkpoints (keep final)
  2. Archive PRP learnings to project knowledge
  3. Reset validation state counters
  4. Run context health check

**Integration Points:**
- `tools/ce/prp.py`: New module
- `tools/ce/__main__.py`: Add `prp` subcommand group
- `tools/ce/core.py`: Integrate checkpoint functions
- Serena MCP: Memory namespace operations
- Model.md Section 3.1.1: WRITE pillar implementation

- PRP template population with researched context
- Validation command inference based on project structure
- Output to `PRPs/PRP-{id}.md` with complete 6-section structure

**Technical Approach:**
- Parse INITIAL.md with regex/structured format (YAML-style sections)
- Orchestrate Serena searches:
  ```python
  patterns = extract_patterns_from_examples(initial_md)
  related_code = search_for_pattern(patterns, path="src/")
  symbols = find_symbol(name_path=target_class, include_body=True)
  ```
- Orchestrate Context7 documentation:
  ```python
  lib_id = resolve_library_id(library_name)
  docs = get_library_docs(lib_id, topic=feature_context)
  ```

          result = run_cmd(cmd)
          if result["success"]:
              return True
          error = parse_error(result["stderr"])

  ```python
  def pre_generation_sync(prp_id: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
      sync_result = context_sync()
      health = context_health()
      if health["drift_score"] > 30:
          abort(f"High drift: {health['drift_score']}%")
      verify_git_clean()
      return health

  def post_execution_sync(prp_id: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
      cleanup(prp_id)
      sync_result = context_sync()
      health = context_health()
      create_final_checkpoint(prp_id)
      return health

      prps = glob("PRPs/PRP-*.md")
      history = [parse_drift_justification(p) for p in prps]
      return history[-last_n:] if last_n else history

  def drift_summary() -> Dict:
      history = get_drift_history()
      return {
          "total_prps": len(history),
          "accepted": count(h for h in history if h["decision"] == "accept"),
          "rejected": count(h for h in history if h["decision"] == "reject"),

## Validation & Testing Strategy

### Per-PRP Validation

Each PRP must pass:
1. **Unit Tests:** Individual functions and modules
2. **Integration Tests:** Component interactions
3. **E2E Tests:** Full feature workflow
4. **Documentation Review:** Updates accurate and complete

### MVP Milestone Validation

After PRP-5 completion:
1. **End-to-End Workflow Test:**
   - Create sample INITIAL.md
   - Run `/generate-prp` → verify 80%+ complete
   - Human validation checkpoint
   - Run `/execute-prp` → verify 10/10 confidence
   - Verify context sync and cleanup

2. **State Isolation Test:**
   - Execute 3 PRPs sequentially
   - Verify no state leakage between executions
   - Verify checkpoints isolated correctly

3. **Performance Benchmarking:**
   - Measure PRP generation time
   - Measure PRP execution time
   - Calculate speed improvement vs manual
   - Verify targets met (10-24x improvement)

### Maturing Milestone Validation

After PRP-9 completion:
1. **Full System Test:**
   - Execute complete PRP lifecycle with all features
   - Verify drift history tracking
   - Run pipeline tests (unit, integration, E2E)
   - Deploy to production environment using guides

2. **Performance at Scale:**
   - Execute 10 PRPs sequentially
   - Measure success rates
   - Verify monitoring captures metrics
   - Validate error recovery

3. **Documentation Audit:**
   - All docs synchronized with code
   - Deployment guide walkthrough
   - Troubleshooting guide covers common issues
