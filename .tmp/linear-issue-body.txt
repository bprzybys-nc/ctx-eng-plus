## PRP-37.1.1: Add Missing Files to Package

**Objective**: Include blend-config.yml and README.md in ce-infrastructure.xml

**Effort**: 1 hour (low complexity)

**Stage**: stage-1-sequential (foundation phase, no dependencies)

### What
Add two missing files to repomix profile:
- .ce/blend-config.yml (blending configuration)
- tools/README.md (CLI documentation)

### Why
E2E testing revealed these files are required during initialization but missing from package, forcing manual workarounds.

### Implementation
1. Update .ce/repomix-profile-infrastructure.yml include section
2. Rebuild packages with build-and-distribute.sh
3. Verify files present in XML package
4. Run E2E tests to confirm no workarounds needed

### Validation Gates
- Files added to repomix profile
- README.md exists in tools/
- Packages rebuilt successfully
- npx repomix --unpack --list shows both files
- E2E test runs without workarounds
