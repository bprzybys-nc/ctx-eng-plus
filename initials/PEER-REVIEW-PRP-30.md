- ✅ Have specific expected outputs
- ✅ Include failure remediation steps
- ✅ Test critical functionality

**Score**: 7/7 - Excellent validation coverage ✅

---

### ✅ Implementation Steps Quality (6/6 Phases)

#### Phase 1: Preserve Work (Merge to Main)

**Quality**: ✅ Excellent

**Strengths**:
- Pre-flight checks included
- Backup tag created before destructive operations
- Merge commit message is comprehensive
- Conflict resolution steps provided
- Validation gate immediately after merge
- Rollback procedure clear

**Time Estimate**: 10-15 minutes (realistic)

---

#### Phase 2: Remove GitButler Branches

**Quality**: ✅ Excellent

**Strengths**:
- Checks for both `gitbutler/workspace` and `feat/gitbutler`
- Conditional deletion (only if branch exists)
- Checks if `feat/gitbutler` has unique commits before deletion
- Deletes both local and remote branches
- Validation gate confirms cleanup

**Time Estimate**: 5 minutes (realistic)

---

#### Phase 3: Remove GitButler Metadata

**Quality**: ✅ Excellent

**Strengths**:
- Verifies directory exists before removal
- Optional test artifact cleanup
- Verifies archive preserved (important!)
- Low risk operation

**Time Estimate**: 5 minutes (realistic)

---

#### Phase 4: Uninstall GitButler App (OPTIONAL)

**Quality**: ✅ Excellent

**Strengths**:
- Clearly marked as OPTIONAL
- Quits app before uninstall
- Removes CLI symlink
- Verifies git still works after removal
- Reversible (trash or reinstall)

**Time Estimate**: 2 minutes (realistic)

**Note**: Good decision to make this optional for users with other projects using GitButler

---

#### Phase 5: Clean Documentation References

**Quality**: ✅ Good (minor optimization opportunity)

**Strengths**:
- Comprehensive search for GitButler references
- Updates two slash commands: `peer-review.md` and `batch-exe-prp.md`
- Verifies CLAUDE.md references correct
- Commit message is clear

**Minor Optimization Opportunity**:

The PRP says to "Update `.claude/commands/peer-review.md`" to remove GitButler integration checks, but the **current `/peer-review` command document** (the one running this review!) is heavily GitButler-focused. This phase will need to do more than just remove `but status` - it will need to:

1. Remove entire GitButler validation section (lines ~20-100)
2. Replace with git worktree validation checks (if needed)
3. Or simplify to basic PRP structure validation

**Recommendation**: During Phase 5 execution, read `peer-review.md` in full and assess if it needs rewrite vs surgical edits.

**Time Estimate**: 15-20 minutes (realistic, given potential rewrite of peer-review.md)

---

#### Phase 6: Final Validation and Context Update

**Quality**: ✅ Excellent

**Strengths**:
- Runs all 7 validation gates
- Integration test (creates and removes worktree)
- Updates context engineering system
- Final verification before sign-off

**Time Estimate**: 5 minutes (realistic)

---

### ✅ Rollback Procedures Quality

**Quality**: ✅ Excellent

**Full Rollback (Nuclear Option)**:
- Clear 4-step procedure
- Restores from backup tag
- Verifies commits present
- Pushes to remote to restore state

**Per-Phase Rollback**:
- Phase 1: `git merge --abort` + checkout gitbutler/workspace
- Phase 2: Recreate branches from backup tag
- Phase 3: No rollback needed (low risk)
- Phase 4: Restore from Trash or reinstall
- Phase 5: `git revert HEAD`

**All rollback procedures are actionable and tested patterns** ✅

---

### ✅ Risk Mitigation Quality

**Quality**: ✅ Excellent

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation | Assessed |
|------|----------|------------|----------|
| Losing 29 commits | HIGH | Backup tag + validation gates | ✅ Excellent |
| Merge conflicts | MEDIUM | Conflict resolution steps + abort procedure | ✅ Good |
| Incomplete removal | MEDIUM | 7 validation gates | ✅ Excellent |
| Breaking git operations | LOW | Validation gate 5 tests git commands | ✅ Good |
| App uninstall issues | LOW | Optional phase + reversible | ✅ Excellent |

**All high/medium risks have comprehensive mitigation** ✅

---

### ✅ Documentation Quality

**Quality**: ✅ Excellent

**Strengths**:
- Clear markdown formatting
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Expected outputs documented
- Inline comments in bash commands
- Links to related PRPs (PRP-C, PRP-D)
- Plan source referenced

**Readability**: 10/10 - Clear for both humans and Haiku execution

---

## Issues Found

### ⚠️ Issue 1: peer-review.md GitButler-Heavy Content (MEDIUM Priority)

**Location**: Phase 5, Step 2

**Problem**: The current `peer-review.md` is heavily GitButler-focused (GitButler checks are ~30% of file). Simple search-and-replace of `but status` won't be sufficient.

**Evidence**: Current peer-review.md structure:
- Lines 1-20: Overview (OK, keep)
- Lines 20-100: **GitButler Virtual Branch Validation** (REMOVE)
- Lines 100-200: Phase completion, validation gates (OK, adapt)
- Lines 200-300: Code quality, context drift (OK, keep)

**Recommendation**:

During Phase 5 execution, either:

**Option A**: Rewrite peer-review.md to focus on PRP structure validation (no git-specific checks)

**Option B**: Replace GitButler checks with git worktree equivalents:
- `but branch list` → `git worktree list`
- `but status` → `git status` (in worktree)
- `but log` → `git log` (in worktree)

**Impact**: LOW - Does not block PRP execution, but Phase 5 may take longer than 15-20 minutes if full rewrite needed

**Resolution**: During Phase 5, use Read tool to assess full scope, then Edit or Write as appropriate

---

## Recommendations

### Critical (Before Execution)

1. ✅ **None** - PRP is ready for execution as-is

### High Priority (During Execution)

1. **Phase 5 - peer-review.md Handling** (addressed in Issue 1 above)
   - Read full file first
   - Assess if rewrite or surgical edits needed
   - Update time estimate if rewrite required

### Medium Priority (Post-Execution)

1. **Backup Tag Cleanup** (noted in Post-Execution Notes)
   - Delete `gitbutler-backup-2025-10-30` after 30 days
   - Document in calendar or reminder system

2. **Linear Issue Creation**
   - Create manually (MCP tool had issues)
   - Update PRP YAML header with issue ID

### Low Priority (Future PRPs)

1. **Template Update**: Add Phase 6 (Final Validation) to PRP template
   - Current template stops at Phase 5
   - PRP-30 added Phase 6 (good practice for git operations)

---

## Code Quality Assessment

**Not Applicable** - This PRP executes git operations and documentation updates, not code implementation.

**However**, validation gates ensure:
- ✅ No git corruption
- ✅ All files preserved
- ✅ Documentation consistency
- ✅ Context system updated

---

## Context Drift Impact

**Predicted Drift**: <5% (LOW)

**Reasoning**:
- Phase 1-4: Git operations (no codebase changes)
- Phase 5: Documentation only (CLAUDE.md, slash commands)
- Phase 6: Runs `ce update-context` to sync

**Post-Execution Expectation**: Context drift should remain <10% (healthy)

---

## Testing Coverage

### Pre-Execution Tests ✅

- Commit verification: `git log | wc -l`
- File verification: `ls PRPs/executed/`
- Branch verification: `git branch -a | grep gitbutler`
- Working directory clean: `git status`

**Coverage**: 100% of prerequisites

### Mid-Execution Tests ✅

- Gate 1 + Gate 2 after Phase 1
- Gate 3 after Phase 2
- Gate 4 after Phase 3
- `which but` after Phase 4
- Gate 6 after Phase 5

**Coverage**: 100% of phases

### Post-Execution Tests ✅

- Integration test: Create and remove git worktree
- Documentation test: Verify markdown links
- Context test: `uv run ce update-context`

**Coverage**: 100% of critical functionality

## Edge Cases Handled

| Edge Case | Handled? | How |
|-----------|----------|-----|
| Merge conflicts in Phase 1 | ✅ Yes | Conflict resolution steps + abort procedure |
| feat/gitbutler has unique commits | ✅ Yes | Conditional check before deletion |
| GitButler app not installed | ✅ Yes | Phase 4 checks if app exists before uninstall |
| .git/gitbutler/ doesn't exist | ✅ Yes | Phase 3 verifies directory before removal |
| Remote push fails (network) | ⚠️ Partial | Mentioned in Testing Strategy, but no explicit retry |
| peer-review.md rewrite needed | ⚠️ Partial | Mentioned in Phase 5, but scope not quantified |

**Recommendation**: Add retry logic note for remote push failures (low priority)

---

## Time Estimate Validation

| Phase | Estimated | Realistic? | Notes |
|-------|-----------|------------|-------|
| Phase 1 | 10-15 min | ✅ Yes | Git merge + push is ~10 min on good network |
| Phase 2 | 5 min | ✅ Yes | Branch deletion is quick |
| Phase 3 | 5 min | ✅ Yes | Simple directory removal |
| Phase 4 | 2 min | ✅ Yes | App uninstall is quick |
| Phase 5 | 15-20 min | ⚠️ Maybe | Could be longer if peer-review.md rewrite needed |
| Phase 6 | 5 min | ✅ Yes | Validation gates are quick |
| **Total** | **37-47 min** | ✅ Yes | **0.75 hours realistic** (with buffer) |

**Note**: Phase 5 could extend to 25-30 minutes if peer-review.md requires full rewrite (still within buffer)

---
