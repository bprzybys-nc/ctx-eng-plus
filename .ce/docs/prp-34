refresh ur context


cresate me initial for prp-34

- we need to generalize blending tool as we need it for:
   - existing CLAUDE.md blending (with RULES.md)
   - existing serena memories blending with existing serena memories
   - existing settings.local.json blending with existing settings.local.json

let the blending it be like this:


1. copy our version
2. import target version in scope not contradicting with our version - if sth important contradicting with our version, ask for clarification
3. deduplicate & denoise to compact readable structured version (with lists tables mermaid diagrams where needed) and no vital information lost!
(u can also check web for proven patterns for such blending)



i think for that we need sth NL based so we need also Claude sdk using same claude code tokens

sth like

tools/ce/blending_tool.py <params if needed>


id like u to think through other symmetries we could find to make our codebase more compact and readable


think. plan efficiently and accurately
