we need accurate detection of existing examples PRPs

these supposed to be ikmplemejntyed during PRP 32.x family
but if werent

most of projects will have PRP[s]{0,1}/ examples/ folders
in root
or in [.]*ce/
or in context-engineering/

b ut there can be also garbage we don't want in new structured
as for prp and examples they gonna have characteristics described in https://github.com/coleam00/context-engineering-intro as all of them where generated bu less or more enhanced version of it 


as for claude related files they are always in .claude/ folderm and CLAUDE.md in root (or their symbiotic links)



=============

also think how to incorporate Claude 4.5 Haiku to lower costs and speed up process

=======



  ad Summary

  Token Usage: ~230K tokens per init
  - CLAUDE.md: ~18K
  - Memories (23 files): ~115K
  - Examples (13 files): ~97.5K

  Context: Claude Code typical conversation = 50-100K tokens
  Impact: Equivalent to 2-4 Claude Code conversations
  Value: Automates 45+ minutes of error-prone manual work))


  try to optimize more for efficiency while preservoing accuracy and quality
